# Welcome to the HUB for the discussion on [Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## What is this?
This is a place where we will keep track of our progress as a group as we all read [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## How to use the repo
Each chapter's notes will be posted in the `Chapters` folder to chat about during our meetings.
